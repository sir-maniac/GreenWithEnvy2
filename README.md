#### Python Dependencies

> **Note:** Some dependencies aren't available in some distributions.  If you have some that are missing,
 it is recommended you install in a virtual environment(like `pipx`) to avoid conflicts with the distribution's packages.

##### Using pip to install missing dependencies

Some dependencies aren't available in some distributions.  If you have some that are missing,
it is recommended you install in a virtual environment(like `pipx`) to avoid conflicts with
the distribution's packages.

If you still want to install globally and are willing to risk the issues, run the following **after installing all
 the packages available for your distribution**.

```bash
# do a dry run and make sure you are okay with the changes pip will make
$ sudo -H pip3 install --dry-run --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt

# Re-run to make the changes.
# WARNING: this might break your system's python packages
$ sudo -H pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
```
</details>

#### Clone project and install

If you have not installed GWE yet:

```bash
git clone --branch release https://github.com/sir-maniac/GreenWithEnvy2.git
cd GreenWithEnvy2
```
##### Install in an environment (recommended)

After installing pipx, run:

```bash
$ pipx install .
```

##### Alterative: Install system-wide

Install as many python packages as you can for your distribution, and install
 any others using pip, as detailed under Python Dependencies.

```bash
$ meson setup . build --prefix /usr/local
$ meson compile -C build
$ sudo meson install -C build
```

#### Update old installation

If you installed GWE2 from source code previously and you want to update it:

Check python requirements above and ensure they are installed/updated

```bash
$ cd GreenWithEnvy2
$ git fetch
$ git checkout release
$ git reset --hard origin/release

# Reinstall with pipx
$ pipx uninstall gwe2 && pipx install .

# Or for a system-wide install
$ meson setup . build --reconfigure --prefix /usr/local
$ meson compile -C build
$ sudo meson install -C build
```
#### Run

Once installed, to start it you can simply execute on a terminal:
```bash
$ gwe2
```

#### ‚ö† Bumblebee and Optimus

If you want to use GWE with Bumblebee you need to start it with `optirun` and set the `--ctrl-display` parameter to `:8`:

```bash
$ optirun gwe2 --ctrl-display ":8"
```

### Packages for the original GWE

The following packages are still available for the original gwe.  They are here informational purposes.
Support for them is limited, as bug fixes and changes won't appear in those packages.

#### Arch Linux

Install the `gwe` package from the AUR using your favourite helper, for example `yay -S gwe`.

#### Fedora

GWE avaliable in official Fedora [repos](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gwe) for F31+: `sudo dnf install gwe`

For older Fedora releases you can use [COPR package](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/gwe/): `sudo dnf copr enable atim/gwe -y && sudo dnf install gwe`

### Flathub Limitations

#### Beta Drivers

Currently [Flatpak does not support Nvidia Beta drivers](https://github.com/flathub/org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia/issues/1)
like 396.54.09 or 415.22.05.

#### Bumblebee and Optimus

Currently [Flatpak does not support Bumblebee](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/869). If you want to use GWE with Bumblebee
you need to install it from the source code.

## Application entry
To add a desktop entry for the application run the following command (not supported by Flatpak):
```bash
gwe --application-entry
```
If you don't want to create this custom rule you can run gwe as root
(using sudo) but we advise against this solution.

## üñ•Ô∏è Build, install and run with Flatpak
If you don't have Flatpak installed you can find step by step instructions [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Make sure to have the Flathub remote added to the current user:

> *Note:* This fork hasn't been submitted to flathub yet, however you can still
 build and install the flatpak package locally.

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://github.com/sir-maniac/GreenWithEnvy2.git
```
It is possible to build the local source or the remote one (the same that Flathub uses)
### Local repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-local --flatpak-install
```
### Remote repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-remote --flatpak-install
```
### Run
```bash
flatpak run io.github.sir_maniac.gwe2 --debug
```

## ‚ùì FAQ
### I see some message about CoolBits in the Overclock/Fan profile section, what's that?
Coolbits was a Windows registry hack for Nvidia graphics cards Windows drivers, that allows
tweaking features via the Nvidia driver control panel.
Something similar is available also on Linux and is the only way to enable Overclock and manual Fan control.
To know more about Coolbits and how to enable them click
[here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Tips_and_tricks#Enabling_overclocking)
(to enable both OC and Fan control you need to set it to `12`).

### Can I make the power limit survive a reboot?
GWE cannot set the power limit automatically because, to change this value, root permission is required.
If your distribution is using systemd, you can easily set the power limit on boot creating a custom service.

Simply create a new file `/etc/systemd/system/nvidia-tdp.timer` and paste the following text inside:
```
[Unit]
Description=Set NVIDIA power limit on boot

[Timer]
OnBootSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Then create another file `/etc/systemd/system/nvidia-tdp.service` and paste the following text inside (replace `XXX` with the power limit value you want to set):
```
[Unit]
Description=Set NVIDIA power limit

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -pm 1
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -pl XXX
```

Finally, run the following command:
```
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-tdp.timer
```

### The Flatpak version of GWE is not using my theme, how can I fix it?
To fix this issue install a Gtk theme from Flathub. This way, Flatpak applications will automatically pick the
installed Gtk theme and use that instead of Adwaita.

Use this command to get a list of all the available Gtk themes on Flathub:
```bash
flatpak --user remote-ls flathub | grep org.gtk.Gtk3theme
```
And then just install your preferred theme. For example, to install Yaru:
```
flatpak install flathub org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Yaru
```

### I have installed the app using Flatpak, but all the GWE fields are empty
This issue can be usually solved by closing GWE, executing `flatpak update` and starting GWE again.
This is necessary to be sure to have the latest [org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia](https://github.com/flathub/org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia).
If, after the update, all the fields are still empty, feel free to open a new issue on the project tracker.

### Why the memory overclock offsets effectively applied does not match the one set in the Nvidia Settings app?
Because Memory Transfer Rate, what Nvidia Settings reports and changes,
is different from the effective Memory Clock, what is actually being
displayed by GWE. It is also what other Windows applications like MSI Afterburner show.
The Memory Transfer Rate is simply double the Memory Clock.

### Where are the settings and profiles stored on the filesystem?
| Installation type |                     Location                     |
|-------------------|:------------------------------------------------:|
| Flatpak           | `$HOME/.var/app/io.github.sir_maniac.gwe2/`      |
| Source code       | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (usually `$HOME/.config/gwe`) |

### GreenWithEnvy, why using such name?
The name comes from the slogan of the GeForce 8 series, that was "Green with envy".
Nvidia is meant to be pronounced "invidia", which means envy in Latin (and Italian). And their logo is green so, GreenWithEnvy

## üíö How to help the project
### Help is needed for the following topics
 - Support for Wayland (see [#9](https://github.com/sir-maniac/GreenWithEnvy2/issues/9))
 - Snap (see [#10](https://github.com/sir-maniac/GreenWithEnvy2/issues/10))

### Can I support this project some other way?

Something simple that everyone can do is to star it on [GitHub](https://github.com/sir-maniac/GreenWithEnvy2).
Feedback is always welcome: if you found a bug or would like to suggest a feature,
feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sir-maniac/GreenWithEnvy2/issues).
